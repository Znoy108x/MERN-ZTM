      "What is it?\nWhere did it start?\nWhat types of meditation are there?\nDoes meditation need to be spiritual?\nWhat are common misconceptions about meditation?",
      "Week 1 - Breath Awareness: You'll be introduced to your first meditations, which are only 5 minutes long (you can do anything for 5 minutes). You'll also learn all about using specialized breathing techniques like 'box breathing' to make you calm and help you focus.\nWeek 2 - Body Scan & Relaxation: Now you're on a roll, so you're going to level-up to 10 minute meditations! These will teach you body scanning techniques that help you to become more aware of your own thinking processes and how to optimize them for success.\nWeek 3 - Mindfulness: You're creating a great lifelong habit now, so you'll take it up a notch here with 15 minute meditations. Here, you'll learn one of the most important skills taught at ZTM: mindfulness. Mindfulness is about being present in the moment, not constantly dwelling on your past mistakes (we all have them!) or living only for the future. You'll use these meditations to become more mindful at school and at work.\nWeek 4 - Bringing Meditation to Your Everyday Life: Time to bring it home! This week you will solidify your commitment and skills using 20 minute meditations. You'll use this week to incorporate meditation into all aspects of your life too, not just at school or work, to maximize the producitivity and focus benefits that meditation gives you.",
